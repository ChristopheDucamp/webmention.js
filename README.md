pingback-js
===============

A simple script used to parse documents looking for some specific class names of `<ul>` elements and replacing the `<li>` elements within with interesting information parsed from public pingback.me data.
    

## Initial Goals

pingback.js will fetch two types of data:

*   The number of webmentions or pingbacks for a particular page.
*   An `<ul>` of URLs that have sent webmentions or pingback.
    
## Project Status

In development.  Most of the initial work will consist of conceptual tests to come up with an initial design.  Nothing is working as of yet.
