Pingback.js
===============
[Pingback.me](http://Pingback.me) makes it easy to recive incoming pingbacks and webmentions on your webpage or blog.  Pingback.js helps you display them on your gh-pages or statically hosted website. 

## Goals

Pingback.js will process static elements on your pages and turn them into:

*   The number of webmentions or pingbacks recived for a url.
*   A `<ul>` of URLs that have sent webmentions or pingback to a particular url.

Generate the desired static element using your templating engine with the correct `id` attribute and relevant `class` attribute, and Pingback.js should do the rest.
    
## Project Status

In development.  Most of the initial work will consist of conceptual tests to come up with an initial design.  Nothing is working as of yet.
